## About the Project
Comprehensive Analysis Toolkit for Near-field Imaging and Phase-retrieval (CATNIP) is a software tool for rapidly generating simulated datasets based on wave-optics simulations, intended for testing multimodal retrieval algorithms in X-ray near-field imaging. It is developed and maintained by the High-Energy Physics Research Group at Universidad de los Andes (Uniandes). The frontend and backend are implemented in Python, and the graphical interface runs within the CATNIP virtual environment, whose installation is described in the manual.
